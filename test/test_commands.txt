=======================================
Scenario 1 writer 3 readers
    writerIsAlsoReader =1
    FailBack = 0
    with retry Down = 2
----------------------------------
Test : PXC maint
Expectations:
    Writer will go in OFFLINE_SOFT
    Reader will become writer in respect to the weight as declared in the 8000 HG
    On end of maintenance NO failback is expected
    If node is reader then OFFLINE_SOFT then failback
----------------------------------------------------------
Commands :
    on writer = set global pxc_maint_mode = maintenance;

 Results: OK

 Command put just selected writer to maintenance: set global pxc_maint_mode = maintenance;
 Results: OK

 ----------------------------------------------------------
 Test : wsrep_desync (or any state <> 4)
 Expectations:
     Node will go in OFFLINE_SOFT only if HG size > 1
 Command: on any reader: set global wsrep_desync=1;
 Results: OK

 Command: on writer: set global wsrep_desync=1;
 Results:
    WARN[0000] Node: 192.168.4.22:3306 node4 HG: 100 Type W is in state 2 But I will not move to OFFLINE_SOFT given last node left in the Host group
    WARN[0000] Node: 192.168.4.22:3306 node4 HG: 101 Type R is in state 2 moving it to OFFLINE_SOFT given we have other nodes in the Host group
 This is correct given Write HG has 1 node desync should not take place (like if donor).
 For reader HG we have multiple nodes so all good to be desync

 ----------------------------------------------------------
 Test : wsrep_reject_queries <> none
 Expectations: node is moved to HG 9000
 Command on a Reader node: set global READ_ONLY = 1;
 Results: nothing happen

 Command on a writer node: set global READ_ONLY = 1;
 Results: fail-over to the next available backup

 ----------------------------------------------------------
 Test : wsrep_reject_queries <> none
 Expectations: node is moved to HG 9000

 Command: on writer: set global wsrep_reject_queries=all;
 Results: writer goes to 9000 and a new node is elected

 Command: on reader: set global wsrep_reject_queries=all;
 Results: reader goes to 9000

 ----------------------------------------------------------
 Test : on SHUNNED
 Expectations: node is moved to HG 9000 if back online Reader is add back Writer attempt to come back if no writer
